Here are some links to resources on good coding practices and project setup.

- [Better Code Better Science]( https://poldrack.github.io/BetterCodeBetterScience/frontmatter.html) - Full guide on project setup, good coding practices, software testing
- [The Good Research Code Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/_static/book.pdf) - This handbook is for grad students, postdocs and PIs who do a lot of programming as part of their research.
- Use [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/) for version control
- Use [Datalad](https://www.datalad.org/) for version control of datasets. Kinda like git for data.
- Working remotely using [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh-tutorial)
- Use [linters](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting) to highlight semantic and stylistic issues with your code 
- Use [formatters](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/formatting) to automatically apply stylistic changes 
- Use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for management of python versions, virtual environments, python projects, and packages  
- Use [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to setup projects based on a template. 
- Great books: Clean Code (Robert C. Martin), Naming Things (Tom Benner), Design Patterns. Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides)
