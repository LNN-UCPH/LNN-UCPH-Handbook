# Publishing

## Where to Submit
You have completed world changing research and are now looking for a place to publish your work, congratulations!
There are several guides online about how to determine where to submit your work for publishing.
First, you should choose whether to submit your work to a conference (preferrably an indexed one) or a journal.
In order to determine this, you should consider:
1. the type of research you completed (e.x., review paper, short abstract, new methodology, full research paper)
2. what you aim to get out of publishing the work (e.x., some peer review, indexing for citations and h-index, attending a conference for networking)
3. your timeline (e.x., you're graduating soon and losing data access)
