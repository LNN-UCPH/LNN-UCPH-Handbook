# Onboarding

Welcome!

The Lab for [Neuroimaging and Neuroinformatics (LNN @ UCPH)](https://lnn-ucph.github.io/) focuses on leveraging advanced imaging technologies and computational methods to study the human brain. We integrate neuroimaging data with neuroinformatics approaches to understand brain structure, function, and connectivity. Our research areas typically include the development and application of machine learning algorithms, image analysis techniques, and data integration methods to advance the field of neuroscience and improve clinical outcomes in neurology and psychiatry. Our work often involves interdisciplinary collaboration, bridging gaps between computational sciences and neuroscience.

Most of us are located at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Copenhagen, but we also have affiliates located at the [Neurobiology Research Unit](www.nru.dk) of the Copenhagen University Hospital (Rigshospitalet).

## LNN@UCPH Lab Resources

### Research tools

#### Zotero
For literature storage we utilise the open source tool Zotero. Please upload the most important papers for your project to a private Zotero group (https://www.zotero.org/) and add the relevant people to it. Remember to call the Zotero group something specific to your project.

#### Overleaf
For writing papers we use Overleaf. You can get access to Overleaf Premium with your KU e-mail. So make an Overleaf account or use your KU account and make a project and invite the relevant people. For thesis works you can use this template https://www.overleaf.com/edu/ucph
