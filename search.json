That’s why the Department of Computer Science (DIKU) at the University of Copenhagen has a Code of Conduct, which everyone must follow. These guidelines are designed to ensure that everyone feels included and equal. Read the DIKU Code of Conduct here.\n\n\nWork-Life balance\nIt is expected that you check for e-mail updates during the week, but not in the evenings, holidays, or on the weekend. For emergencies please use the private email addresses or any other media that you have agreed with your supervisor on. Following this rule for “life-work-balance”, we should be aware not to expect any comments, reviews or other replies to any issue in the evening of the same day, on holidays or throughout weekends.\n\n\nExpectations of lab engagement\nWe expect all lab members to engage actively in the lab. While we don’t have standard lab meetings, since we are embedded in larger groups, we organize lab events and hackathons and we expect you to participate in them.\n\n\nFeedback\nAs a member of the LNN, we expect you to be interested in learning and improving how science is carried out, both professionally and personally. This involves being able to provide and receive feedback. This is something that we strive towards ourselves every day, however, if you think that we can do better at something, or the lab can work better or improve, please let us know. For example, if you think there is something that we are not providing, but we should, please let us know. We think that one should feel comfortable to be as open-minded as possible to grow as a scientist, and this involves providing constructive and respectful feedback.\n\n\nWorking remotely\nOur lab is embedded in different institutions and in general we need to follow the rules set by them regarding working remotely. But in general we support working from home a day a week and also when you travel home in order to give you the possibility to avoid e.g. holiday traffic and reduce travel costs for you.\n\n\nSickness, Health and Personal Emergencies\nStay at home and take care of yourself if you are sick. You owe it to yourself to get better and to others who should risk getting sick at work. Please notify your supervisor and reschedule meetings for another day. We are actively trying to create a good work environment to prevent work-related stress. However, sometimes life happens, and you or other lab members will have emergencies that need to be attended to. The lab leadership will always try to help and provide resources, personally and professionally, so do not hesitate to reach out to us. For reporting sick days or emergency leave, please follow the rules set by your place of employment, either DIKU or NRU.",

    "text": "Slurm User Guide\nThe wiki of DIKU\n\n\n\n1. Accessing the cluster\nTo access the cluster you need the following things:\n\nYour institutional credentials (user ID + password)\nRequest “SRV-hendrixgate-users” through identity.ku.dk\n\nEmployees should send a mail to cluster-access@di.ku.dk\nStudents should have their supervisor send a mail to cluster-access@di.ku.dk, or cc their supervisor for confirmation that they need cluster access.\nWhether you are a student or an employee, you should include your ku-id in the mail as well as your research section affiliation (students should write student). This drastically reduced the time it will take to get access.\n\nYou need network access (either physically on site or via VPN(https://kunet.ku.dk/employee-guide/Pages/IT/Remote-access.aspx)). Remote access requires you to be on the correct network.\n\nFor external guests:\n\nAccess to the cluster infrastructure requires an active account. Access for external guests can be requested by a KU employee via https://identity.ku.dk/ -&gt; “Menu button” -&gt; “Manage Identity” -&gt; “Create external guest”. Make sure that the checkbox next to “Science guest” is ticked.\nThe guest user must then follow the instructions outlined in the e-mail they receive. Afterwards they can request the required role via “https://identity-guest.ku.dk/identityiq/login.jsf” -&gt; “Login” -&gt; “Manage My Access” -&gt; “Search” -&gt; Select check button next to “SRV-hendrixgate-users” -&gt; “Next” -&gt; “Submit”.\nAfterwards the KU employee should send an e-mail to cluster-access@di.ku.dk including the external guest’s e-mail address as well as their name or user id. Once the external guest receives our welcome e-mail they should follow the steps below.\n\n\n\n2. First time setup\nHendrix can be accessed via a two-layer access: - First you connect to the university network, and then you use ssh to connect to the server. To connect to the university network, either use a direct network cable connection in your office or use VPN - For the second step, you need to install and configure ssh. Put the following in your ~/.ssh/config (Linux/MacOS) or in C:/Users/YOUR_WINDOWS_USER/.ssh/config (Windows, a simple text file with no file ending!):\nHost hendrix\n    HostName hendrixgate\n    User &lt;kuid&gt;\n    StrictHostKeyChecking no\n    CheckHostIP no\n    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null\nNow you will be able to connect to hendrix by opening a terminal and writing:\nssh hendrix\n\n\n3. Available resources\nThere are a few limits, decided by the cluster usergroup and enforced by the system which it may be helpfull to be aware of:\n\nThere is a limit of 8 gpus per user, which means that any jobs exceeding this limit will be rejected at queue time\nThe default timelimit for a job is 5 hours, which means that any job that does not have an explicit timelimit will terminate after 5 hours regardless if the job has finished.\nThere is a max timelimit for a job of 48 hours. this means that all jobs will terminate after 48 hours regardless if the job has finished.\n\nAvailable GPUs:\n\n\n\nResource-Name\nModel\nCount\nMemory(GB)\n\n\n\n\nh100\nNvidia H100\n4\n80\n\n\na100\nNvidia A100\n26\n80/40\n\n\na40\nNvidia A40\n14\n40\n\n\ntitanrtx\nTitan RTX + Quadro RTX 6000\n55\n??\n\n\ntitanx\nTitan X/Xp/V\n15\n??\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Basic SLURM commands & job submission script\n\nsrun: run a job interactively on the cluster.\nsbatch: submit a batch job script.\nsqueue: view jobs in the queue (yours or all).\nscancel &lt;jobid&gt;: cancel a job.\nsinfo: show the state of partitions and nodes.\n\nExample batch script (bash + SLURM directives):\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=my_job\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.log\n#SBATCH --error=error_%j.log\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4\n#SBATCH -p gpu --gres=gpu:titanx:2\n#SBATCH --mem=8G\n#SBATCH --time=02:00:00\n#SBATCH --partition=normal_prio\n\nmodule purge\nmodule load python/3.9\n# other modules as needed\n\necho \"Starting job on $(hostname)\"\npython my_script.py --input data/input.txt --output results/out.txt\nThis can now be submitted using:\nsbatch this_script.sh\nNice-to-knows:\n\nModule system: Use module avail to list available software packages, and module load {package/version} to load the ones you need. Purge old modules at start to avoid conflicts.\nInteractive sessions: Use srun --pty bash (or salloc) if you want an interactive shell on a compute node (e.g., for testing)\n\n\n\nMounting ERDA\nTo mount ERDA on Hendrix, start by making a RSA key on Hendrix by opening a terminal and running:\nssh-keygen -t rsa\nCopy your SSH public key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) into ERDA under setup -&gt; SFTP -&gt; Public Keys.\nScript to Mount ERDA: Save the following as mount_erda.sh and make it executable (chmod +x mount_erda.sh):\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Variables (replace placeholders with your info)\nKEY=~/.ssh/id_rsa             # Path to your private key\nUSER=your_erda_username       # e.g., xxx999@di.ku.dk\nERDADIR=./                     # Remote directory on ERDA to mount\nMNT=~/erda_mount               # Local mount point\n\n# Check if the private key exists\nif [ ! -f \"$KEY\" ]; then\n    echo \"Error: Private key '$KEY' not found.\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n# Create the mount point if it doesn't exist\nmkdir -p \"${MNT}\"\n\n# Check if the directory is empty\nif [ \"$(ls -A ${MNT})\" ]; then\n    echo \"Mount point '${MNT}' is not empty.

    "text": "How to Choose a Journal\nChoosing a journal for submission can be daunting. The first step would be to explore the papers that you cite the most and the papers that are most alike your own work – which journals are they published in? These journals likely have a scope that includes your own work. The second step is to discuss the impact factor of these journals, and your publication goals. The higher the impact factor, the more rigorous the reviews, and the lower the odds of being accepted. There are several tools online to use, and don’t be afraid to lean on your mentors for suggestions.",
