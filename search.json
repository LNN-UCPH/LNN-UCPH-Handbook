The handbook provides an overview of our lab philosophy and practical information on how to get started on a research project. Whether you’re a new member of the lab looking for onboarding help, an existing member who is curious about obtaining your own funding, or a prospective student wondering about our lab culture, this is the place for you! If you have a suggestion or comment on the handbook, please reach out to Melanie or Martin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote to lab members: this document is a work in progress and may change.

That’s why the Department of Computer Science (DIKU) at the University of Copenhagen has a Code of Conduct, which everyone must follow. These guidelines are designed to ensure that everyone feels included and equal. Read the DIKU Code of Conduct here.\n\n\nWork-Life balance\nIt is expected that you check for e-mail updates during the week, but not in the evenings, holidays, or on the weekend. For emergencies please use the private email addresses or any other media that you have agreed with your supervisor on. Following this rule for “life-work-balance”, we should be aware not to expect any comments, reviews or other replies to any issue in the evening of the same day, on holidays or throughout weekends.\n\n\nExpectations of lab engagement\nWe expect all lab members to engage actively in the lab. While we don’t have standard lab meetings, since we are embedded in larger groups, we organize lab events and hackathons and we expect you to participate in them.\n\n\nFeedback\nAs a member of the LNN, we expect you to be interested in learning and improving how science is carried out, both professionally and personally. This involves being able to provide and receive feedback. This is something that we strive towards ourselves every day, however, if you think that we can do better at something, or the lab can work better or improve, please let us know. For example, if you think there is something that we are not providing, but we should, please let us know. We think that one should feel comfortable to be as open-minded as possible to grow as a scientist, and this involves providing constructive and respectful feedback.\n\n\nWorking remotely\nOur lab is embedded in different institutions and in general we need to follow the rules set by them regarding working remotely. But in general we support working from home a day a week and also when you travel home in order to give you the possibility to avoid e.g. holiday traffic and reduce travel costs for you.\n\n\nSickness, Health and Personal Emergencies\nStay at home and take care of yourself if you are sick. You owe it to yourself to get better and to others who should risk getting sick at work. Please notify your supervisor and reschedule meetings for another day. We are actively trying to create a good work environment to prevent work-related stress. However, sometimes life happens, and you or other lab members will have emergencies that need to be attended to. The lab leadership will always try to help and provide resources, personally and professionally, so do not hesitate to reach out to us. For reporting sick days or emergency leave, please follow the rules set by your place of employment, either DIKU or NRU.",
