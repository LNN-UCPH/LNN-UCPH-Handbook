    "section": "Scientific Conduct",
    "text": "Scientific Conduct\n\nReproducibility\nEnhancing the reproducibility of research is one of the core values of the LNN@UCPH. We strive to ensure the reproducibility of our research, meaning that we provide all the necessary data and the computer code to run the analysis we have performed again, re-creating the results (see the Turing Way Handbook for more details). You can find resources to improve the reproducibility of your research in the lab handbook under the following sections.\n\n\nResearch conduct\nAll persons involved in research in the LNN@UCPH and at UCPH (regardless of their professional level) must familiarise themselves with and abide by UCPH’s Code of Conduct for Responsible Research. The lab and UCPH takes research misconduct seriously and will not tolerate fabrication, falsification, deletion of data or plagiarism committed willfully, or under gross negligence in planning, performing, or reporting research.\n\n\nAuthorship guidelines\nIn general, we follow the University of Copenhagen Code for Authorship, which closely aligns with the Vancouver (ICMJE) guidelines and requires that all co-authors make genuine contributions to the published work.\nIn line with the ICMJE recommendations on Defining the Role of Authors and Contributors, authorship should be based on the following four criteria:\n\nSubstantial contributions to the conception or design of the work, or to the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data; AND\nDrafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND\nFinal approval of the version to be published; AND\nAccountability for all aspects of the work, ensuring that any questions related to accuracy or integrity are appropriately investigated and resolved.\n\nImportantly, we consider substantial contributions to data acquisition or analysis alone to be sufficient for authorship on the primary project manuscript, provided that criteria 2–4 are also met.\nThe sharing of data, however, is not considered sufficient for authorship; in such cases, appropriate credit should instead be given by citing a data descriptor and/or dataset DOI. Authorship is appropriate when the dataset owner provides substantial intellectual input into the research or when required by a data use agreement.\nWe encourage discussions about author list and order early in the project and revisit these conversations as projects evolve or new contributors become involved. The student or postdoc driving a project should generally expect to be first author, but if they hand off the project, they may lose first authorship unless co-first authorship is warranted.\nIn general, everyone who contributes meaningfully to a paper should be included as long as they fulfill the authorship guidelines.",

    "text": "Lab environment\n\nCode of Conduct\nIt is important that everyone at the department treats each other with respect and empathy. That’s why the Department of Computer Science (DIKU) at the University of Copenhagen has a Code of Conduct, which everyone must follow. These guidelines are designed to ensure that everyone feels included and equal. Read the DIKU Code of Conduct here.\n\n\nWork-Life balance\nIt is expected that you check for e-mail updates during the week, but not in the evenings, holidays, or on the weekend. For emergencies please use the private email addresses or any other media that you have agreed with your supervisor on. Following this rule for “life-work-balance”, we should be aware not to expect any comments, reviews or other replies to any issue in the evening of the same day, on holidays or throughout weekends.\n\n\nExpectations of lab engagement\nWe expect all lab members to engage actively in the lab. While we don’t have standard lab meetings, since we are embedded in larger groups, we organize lab events and hackathons and we expect you to participate in them.\n\n\nFeedback\nAs a member of the LNN, we expect you to be interested in learning and improving how science is carried out, both professionally and personally. This involves being able to provide and receive feedback. This is something that we strive towards ourselves every day, however, if you think that we can do better at something, or the lab can work better or improve, please let us know. For example, if you think there is something that we are not providing, but we should, please let us know. We think that one should feel comfortable to be as open-minded as possible to grow as a scientist, and this involves providing constructive and respectful feedback.\n\n\nWorking remotely\nOur lab is embedded in different institutions and in general we need to follow the rules set by them regarding working remotely. But in general we support working from home a day a week and also when you travel home in order to give you the possibility to avoid e.g. holiday traffic and reduce travel costs for you.\n\n\nSickness, Health and Personal Emergencies\nStay at home and take care of yourself if you are sick. You owe it to yourself to get better and to others who should risk getting sick at work. Please notify your supervisor and reschedule meetings for another day. We are actively trying to create a good work environment to prevent work-related stress. However, sometimes life happens, and you or other lab members will have emergencies that need to be attended to. The lab leadership will always try to help and provide resources, personally and professionally, so do not hesitate to reach out to us. For reporting sick days or emergency leave, please follow the rules set by your place of employment, either DIKU or NRU.\n\n\nReporting facility management issues\nIf you have any facility management issues to report, such as a broken light, please follow the guidelines outlined on the DIKU homepage and the NRU staff manual (necessitates login).\n\n\nReporting other issues\nIn general, please always feel free to reach out to the lab leadership with any issues. If you want to report any other issues that relate to offensive behavior and do not want to involve lab leadership, then feel free to consult the University of Copenhagen guidelines. At NRU, follow procedures described in the NRU staff manual (necessitates login).",

    "text": "Guide for project setup:\nIn general, it is recommended to read through the Essential Tools and Techniques for an extensive guide on tools to use, and Project Setup for a more elaborate guide on how to set up projects. Following is a brief guide on how to set up a Python project using uv and cookiecutter.\n\nStep 1: Install basic tools\n\nInstall git for version control.\nInstall uv. You can install it via pip, but it is recommended to install it standalone.\nInstall cookiecutter via uv:\n\nuv tool install cookiecutter\n\n\nStep 2: Create a new project\nInitialize a new Python project using cookiecutter. There are many different templates available online. A simple one for Python projects could be gh:RDoerfel/simple-cookiecutter or gh:patrickmineault/true-neutral-cookiecutter. A more major one for complex projects could be gh:CBS-HPC/replication_package:\nIn your root directory, run:\ncookiecutter gh:RDoerfel/simple-cookiecutter\nThis will prompt you to enter some information about your project, like the project name, author name, etc. After you have entered all the information, cookiecutter will create a new directory with the project structure based on the template. Once done, navigate into your new project directory:\ncd your_project_name\nls -a\nIf you used the simple-cookiecutter template, you should see a structure like this:\nyour-project-name/\n├── your_package_name/     # Main source code\n├── data/                  # Data files\n├── docs/                  # Documentation\n├── notebooks/             # Jupyter notebooks\n├── results/               # Analysis results\n├── scripts/               # Utility scripts\n├── tests/                 # Test files\n├── .gitignore\n├── LICENSE\n├── README.md\n└── pyproject.toml         # Poetry configuration\n\n\nStep 3: Set up Python environment\nNow select a specific Python version and initialize a new environment using uv:\nuv python install 3.12\nuv venv --python 3.12\nThis will create a new virtual environment for your project and a pyproject.toml file to manage your dependencies.\nIf you already have a pyproject.toml available, probably created from cookiecutter, you can skip the previous step and just run\nuv sync\nYou can now add dependencies to your project using uv. For example, to add numpy and pandas, run:\nuv add numpy pandas\nThis will install the packages and add them to your pyproject.toml file.\n\n\nStep 4: Version control\nNow you can start adding your code and files to the project. Remember to commit your changes regularly using git. First start by initializing your local git repository:\ngit init\nIf you want to add a remote repository, for example on GitHub, you can do so by running:\ngit remote add origin your_remote_repository_url\nIt is recommended to use ssh for authentication instead of https. Now start by adding all files and pushing your first commit:\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\ngit push -u origin main\nIn the future, you can just add, commit and push your changes regularly. Keep commits small, i.e., one commit per feature or bugfix, and add meaningful commit messages. You can always revert to previous versions if something goes wrong. It is much easier if you have a fine-grained git history.",

Accessing the cluster\nTo access the cluster you need the following things:\n\nYour institutional credentials (user ID + password)\nRequest “SRV-hendrixgate-users” through identity.ku.dk\n\nEmployees should send a mail to cluster-access@di.ku.dk\nStudents should have their supervisor send a mail to cluster-access@di.ku.dk, or cc their supervisor for confirmation that they need cluster access.\nWhether you are a student or an employee, you should include your ku-id in the mail as well as your research section affiliation (students should write student). This drastically reduced the time it will take to get access.\n\nYou need network access (either physically on site or via VPN(https://kunet.ku.dk/employee-guide/Pages/IT/Remote-access.aspx)). Remote access requires you to be on the correct network.\n\nFor external guests:\n\nAccess to the cluster infrastructure requires an active account. Access for external guests can be requested by a KU employee via https://identity.ku.dk/ -&gt; “Menu button” -&gt; “Manage Identity” -&gt; “Create external guest”. Make sure that the checkbox next to “Science guest” is ticked.\nThe guest user must then follow the instructions outlined in the e-mail they receive. Afterwards they can request the required role via “https://identity-guest.ku.dk/identityiq/login.jsf” -&gt; “Login” -&gt; “Manage My Access” -&gt; “Search” -&gt; Select check button next to “SRV-hendrixgate-users” -&gt; “Next” -&gt; “Submit”.\nAfterwards the KU employee should send an e-mail to cluster-access@di.ku.dk including the external guest’s e-mail address as well as their name or user id. Once the external guest receives our welcome e-mail they should follow the steps below.\n\n\n\n2. First time setup\nHendrix can be accessed via a two-layer access: - First you connect to the university network, and then you use ssh to connect to the server. To connect to the university network, either use a direct network cable connection in your office or use VPN - For the second step, you need to install and configure ssh. Put the following in your ~/.ssh/config (Linux/MacOS) or in C:/Users/YOUR_WINDOWS_USER/.ssh/config (Windows, a simple text file with no file ending!):\nHost hendrix\n    HostName hendrixgate\n    User &lt;kuid&gt;\n    StrictHostKeyChecking no\n    CheckHostIP no\n    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null\nNow you will be able to connect to hendrix by opening a terminal and writing:\nssh hendrix\n\n\n3. Available resources\nThere are a few limits, decided by the cluster usergroup and enforced by the system which it may be helpfull to be aware of:\n\nThere is a limit of 8 gpus per user, which means that any jobs exceeding this limit will be rejected at queue time\nThe default timelimit for a job is 5 hours, which means that any job that does not have an explicit timelimit will terminate after 5 hours regardless if the job has finished.\nThere is a max timelimit for a job of 48 hours. this means that all jobs will terminate after 48 hours regardless if the job has finished.\n\nAvailable GPUs:\n\n\n\nResource-Name\nModel\nCount\nMemory(GB)\n\n\n\n\nh100\nNvidia H100\n4\n80\n\n\na100\nNvidia A100\n26\n80/40\n\n\na40\nNvidia A40\n14\n40\n\n\ntitanrtx\nTitan RTX + Quadro RTX 6000\n55\n??\n\n\ntitanx\nTitan X/Xp/V\n15\n??\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Basic SLURM commands & job submission script\n\nsrun: run a job interactively on the cluster.\nsbatch: submit a batch job script.\nsqueue: view jobs in the queue (yours or all).\nscancel &lt;jobid&gt;: cancel a job.\nsinfo: show the state of partitions and nodes.\n\nExample batch script (bash + SLURM directives):\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=my_job\n#SBATCH --output=output_%j.log\n#SBATCH --error=error_%j.log\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4\n#SBATCH -p gpu --gres=gpu:titanx:2\n#SBATCH --mem=8G\n#SBATCH --time=02:00:00\n#SBATCH --partition=normal_prio\n\nmodule purge\nmodule load python/3.9\n# other modules as needed\n\necho \"Starting job on $(hostname)\"\npython my_script.py --input data/input.txt --output results/out.txt\nThis can now be submitted using:\nsbatch this_script.sh\nNice-to-knows:\n\nModule system: Use module avail to list available software packages, and module load {package/version} to load the ones you need.

EuroHPC has, at this point, procured 11 supercomputers with gpu and high storage capacity. They offer free access to these computers for a certain amount of compute resources per computer. Certain access calls require more information to apply, so read carefully about the difference between them. We have had luck submitting applications to the Development Access Calls, wherein we are given a 1 year term for compute resources. You can find examples of successful applications on our lab Github Repo ‘euro-hpc-applications’. You may have to ask Martin/Melanie for access to the repo.

    "text": "How to Choose a Journal\nChoosing a journal for submission can be daunting. The first step would be to explore the papers that you cite the most and the papers that are most alike your own work – which journals are they published in? These journals likely have a scope that includes your own work. The second step is to discuss the impact factor of these journals, and your publication goals. The higher the impact factor, the more rigorous the reviews, and the lower the odds of being accepted. There are several tools online to use, and don’t be afraid to lean on your mentors for suggestions.",
